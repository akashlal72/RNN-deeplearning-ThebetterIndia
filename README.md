**Problem statement**: The better India is the world's largest positive and solution
based content driven impact platform. They use their website to share the contents
around the world in the form of articles and other forms of media. The problem we are
facing is to segregate or automate the process of classification of these articles into
separate categories using AI for better reach to the right audience. We are using deep
learning for this purpose.

Automating categorization of online news articles using AI to improve user engagement
and improved website traffic.
